# Generation Instructions for current_tasks.md

## Context

This file serves as:
- **Active work tracker** (what's being worked on now)
- **Priority queue** (what's next)
- **Blocker visibility** (what's stuck and why)
- **Progress dashboard** (what's been completed)

**Audience**: Team members (primary), stakeholders (secondary)
**Tone**: Clear, action-oriented, current
**Target Length**: 150-200 lines (template will grow as tasks are added)

## Input Data

```json
{
  "project_name": "string",
  "generation_date": "YYYY-MM-DD"
}
```

**Note**: This file is a **template** that users will fill in with actual tasks. Generate a well-structured template with clear examples.

**Tip**: Keep this file current! It's most useful when it reflects reality.

See [Task Management Guide](./task-management-guide.md) for task format guidelines.
See `tasks/` directory for detailed per-feature tracking.
```

### Key Template Formatting Rules

1. **Placeholders**: Use `[Name]`, `[Date]`, `[Description]` format (NOT {{VARIABLES}})
2. **Checkboxes**: `- [x]` for completed, `- [ ]` for pending
3. **Tables**: Markdown table format with pipes and headers
4. **Section separators**: Use `---` between entries
5. **Emphasis**: Keep template structure visible with clear section headers

### Style Guidelines

1. **Clear structure**: Consistent formatting for all entries
2. **Actionable**: Every section should be clear what it's for
3. **Scannable**: Easy to see status at a glance
4. **Context links**: Show where to link PRDs, specs, PRs, issues
5. **Helpful instructions**: Usage guide explains maintenance
6. **Concise**: This is a template, users will expand it

## Example: Input/Output

**Input:**
```json
{
  "project_name": "Minerals Platform",
  "generation_date": "2025-01-13"
}
```

**Output structure:** Follow the template structure defined in Output Requirements section above. Replace {Project Name} with "Minerals Platform" and {generation_date} with "2025-01-13".

**Important:** Do NOT repeat the entire template here. The Output Requirements section above is the canonical template.
