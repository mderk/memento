## What is the Memory Bank?

The Memory Bank is a comprehensive documentation system that serves as the **single source of truth** for all technical information about the Minerals Platform. It contains architecture decisions, development workflows, design patterns, and everything you need to understand and contribute to the project.

Unlike scattered documentation in wikis, comments, or chat history, the Memory Bank is:
- **Structured**: Organized by purpose (guides, workflows, patterns)
- **Current**: Actively maintained alongside code
- **Accessible**: Located in `.memory_bank/` in the repository
- **AI-Friendly**: Designed for both human developers and AI assistants

This documentation is used daily by:
- **Developers**: To understand architecture, patterns, and workflows
- **AI Assistants**: To prime context and provide informed suggestions
- **New Team Members**: To onboard quickly
- **Future You**: To remember why decisions were made

The Memory Bank follows a specific structure to make information easy to find:
- **Core docs** for project overview
- **Guides** for deep technical topics
- **Workflows** for step-by-step processes
- **Patterns** for reusable solutions
- **Specs** for feature specifications

## Quick Start

### For AI Assistants

## Navigation Tips

**Finding Information:**

Search for keywords:
'''bash
grep -r "keyword" .memory_bank/
'''

Find files by name:
'''bash
find .memory_bank/ -name "*pattern*"
'''

**Link Patterns:**
- Core docs: `./filename.md`
- Guides: `./guides/filename.md`
- Workflows: `./workflows/filename.md`
- Patterns: `./patterns/filename.md`

**File Naming:**
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `feature-development.md`
- Be descriptive: `backend.md` not `be.md`
- Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood

**Creating New Documentation:**
- **Guides**: Deep technical topics that don't change often
- **Workflows**: Step-by-step processes that may evolve
- **Patterns**: Reusable solutions for common problems
- **Specs**: Detailed feature specifications
- **Tasks**: Granular task breakdowns

## Maintenance

**Keeping Documentation Current:**

This documentation should be updated:
- **Immediately**: When architecture changes
- **Weekly**: Current tasks and active work
- **Monthly**: Workflow improvements and new patterns
- **Quarterly**: Complete review and cleanup

**Ownership:**
- **Tech Lead**: Architecture, core docs, patterns
- **Team**: Guides related to their expertise
- **Everyone**: Workflows they use, tasks they create

**Archiving:**

When documentation becomes outdated:
1. Move to `.memory_bank/archive/`
2. Update links pointing to it
3. Add deprecation note in original location

## Integration with Claude Code

This project uses Claude Code AI assistant with specialized capabilities.

**Priming Context:**

Before any coding task:
'''bash
/prime
'''

This loads Memory Bank into Claude's context.

**Available Commands:**

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/prime` | Load Memory Bank context |
| `/code-review <file>` | Review code with @code-reviewer |
| `/run-tests` | Execute tests with @test-runner |
| `/create-prd <feature>` | Generate product requirements |
| `/create-spec <prd>` | Generate technical spec from PRD |
| `/generate-tasks <spec>` | Break down spec into tasks |

**Available Agents:**

| Agent | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `@code-reviewer` | After implementing features |
| `@test-runner` | To run and analyze test results |
| `@design-reviewer` | For UI/UX review |
| `@research-analyst` | To research APIs/libraries |
| `@Explore` | To understand codebase structure |

See `./guides/ai-agent-handbook.md` for complete guide.

### Example 2: FastAPI API-only (Abbreviated)

**Input:**
```json
{
  "project_name": "Payments API",
  "project_type": "api",
  "backend_framework": "FastAPI",
  "frontend_framework": null,
  "is_monorepo": false,
  "has_frontend": false,
  "has_backend": true,
  "dev_command": "uvicorn main:app --reload",
  "test_command": "pytest",
  "generation_date": "2025-01-13"
}
```

**Key Differences in Output:**
- No frontend guides section
- No visual-design.md
- No @design-reviewer agent
- Simpler directory structure
- Backend-focused quick start

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Including frontend sections when has_frontend is false
2. ❌ Wrong directory structure for monorepo vs single-project
3. ❌ Broken links to non-existent files
4. ❌ Commands that don't match project's tech stack
5. ❌ Generic descriptions that could apply to any project
6. ❌ Missing conditional guides (backend.md, frontend.md)
7. ❌ Outdated generation date
8. ❌ Inconsistent table formatting
9. ❌ Absolute paths instead of relative
10. ❌ Too short or too long (aim for 200-400 lines)

## Validation
