# Generation Instructions for guides/index.md

## Context

You are generating the index file for the guides/ directory - a navigation hub that lists all available guides and helps users find the right guide for their needs.

This file serves as:
- **Directory overview** for all guides
- **Quick reference** to find relevant guide
- **Categorized navigation** by topic

**Audience**: Developers, AI assistants
**Tone**: Clear, organized, helpful
**Length**: 80-120 lines

## Input Data

```json
{
  "project_name": "string",
  "has_frontend": true|false,
  "has_backend": true|false,
  "has_database": true|false
}
```

## Output Requirements

### Structure

Generate guides/index.md with these sections:

#### 1. Header
```markdown
# Guides Index

This directory contains in-depth guides for working with {Project Name}.
```

#### 2. Overview
Brief paragraph explaining:
- What guides are (deep technical documentation)
- How they differ from workflows (guides = knowledge, workflows = processes)
- When to use guides vs workflows

#### 3. Available Guides

Organize guides into categories:

**Development Essentials** (always include):
- `getting-started.md` - Development environment setup and first steps
- `architecture.md` - System architecture and design decisions

**Backend Development** (if has_backend):
- `backend.md` - Backend framework patterns and best practices

**Frontend Development** (if has_frontend):
- `frontend.md` - Frontend framework patterns and component architecture
- `visual-design.md` - Design system and UI component library

**Quality & Testing** (always include):
- `testing.md` - Testing strategy, patterns, and best practices
- `code-review-guidelines.md` - Code review standards and checklist

**Process & Workflow** (always include):
- `ai-agent-handbook.md` - Working with AI agents effectively

#### 4. Guide Format

Explain what each guide contains:
- **Purpose**: What the guide covers
- **When to use**: Situations where this guide is helpful
- **Structure**: Typical sections (overview, patterns, examples, best practices)

#### 5. Navigation Tips

- How to search guides: `grep -r "keyword" guides/`
- How to find related workflows: link to `../workflows/index.md`
- How to find patterns: link to `../patterns/index.md`

#### 6. Contributing

Brief note on:
- Guides should be updated when architecture/patterns change
- Keep guides focused on "why" and "how", not just "what"
- Include examples and anti-patterns

### Conditional Logic

**If has_backend:**
Include backend.md in list

**If has_frontend:**
Include both frontend.md and visual-design.md in list

**If !has_backend:**
Omit backend.md from list

**If !has_frontend:**
Omit frontend.md and visual-design.md from list

### Style Guidelines

1. **Scannable structure**: Use tables or lists for guide inventory
2. **Clear categories**: Group related guides together
3. **Brief descriptions**: One sentence per guide
4. **Consistent format**: Same structure for all guide entries
5. **Helpful navigation**: Make it easy to find the right guide

### Quality Checklist

- [ ] Header clearly identifies this as guides index
- [ ] Overview explains guides vs workflows
- [ ] All guides listed with descriptions
- [ ] Conditional guides included/excluded correctly
- [ ] Categories make logical sense
- [ ] Navigation tips are actionable
- [ ] Links to related directories (workflows/, patterns/)
- [ ] No {{PLACEHOLDERS}} remain
- [ ] Grammar and formatting perfect

## Examples

### Example 1: Full-Stack Project

**Input:**
```json
{
  "project_name": "TaskFlow",
  "has_frontend": true,
  "has_backend": true,
  "has_database": true
}
```

**Output:**

```markdown
# Guides Index

This directory contains in-depth guides for working with TaskFlow.

## What are Guides?

Guides provide deep technical documentation on specific topics. Unlike workflows (which are step-by-step processes), guides explain **concepts, patterns, and best practices**.

**Use guides when:**
- Learning a new part of the system
- Understanding why things are done a certain way
- Looking for patterns and examples

**Use workflows when:**
- You need to accomplish a specific task
- Following a step-by-step process
- Executing a standardized procedure

## Available Guides

### Development Essentials

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `getting-started.md` | Set up your development environment and run the project locally |
| `architecture.md` | Understand the system architecture, component interactions, and design decisions |

### Backend Development

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `backend.md` | Django patterns, API design, database interactions, and backend best practices |

### Frontend Development

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `frontend.md` | React component architecture, state management, and frontend patterns |
| `visual-design.md` | Design system, UI component library, and accessibility standards |

### Quality & Testing

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `testing.md` | Testing philosophy, unit/integration/e2e test patterns, and coverage goals |
| `code-review-guidelines.md` | Code review standards, checklist, and quality criteria |

### Process & Workflow

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ai-agent-handbook.md` | When and how to invoke AI agents for maximum effectiveness |

## Guide Format

Each guide follows a consistent structure:

- **Overview**: What this guide covers and why it matters
- **Concepts**: Core ideas and terminology
- **Patterns**: Reusable solutions and best practices
- **Examples**: Real code examples from the project
- **Anti-patterns**: Common mistakes to avoid
- **References**: Links to related guides, workflows, and external resources

## Navigation

**Finding Information:**

Search all guides for a keyword:
'''bash
grep -r "authentication" guides/
'''

Find guides by topic:
'''bash
find guides/ -name "*auth*"
'''

**Related Documentation:**
- [Workflows](../workflows/index.md) - Step-by-step processes
- [Patterns](../patterns/index.md) - Reusable design patterns
- [Tech Stack](../tech_stack.md) - Technology decisions

## Contributing

**When to Update Guides:**
- Architecture changes
- New patterns emerge
- Best practices evolve
- Framework upgrades

**Writing Good Guides:**
- Focus on "why" and "how", not just "what"
- Include concrete examples from the project
- Show both good patterns and anti-patterns
- Keep language clear and accessible
- Update regularly to stay current

---

**Tip**: Start with `getting-started.md` and `architecture.md` to understand the system, then dive into topic-specific guides as needed.
```

### Example 2: API-Only Project (No Frontend)

**Input:**
```json
{
  "project_name": "Payments API",
  "has_frontend": false,
  "has_backend": true,
  "has_database": true
}
```

**Key Differences:**
- No "Frontend Development" section
- No frontend.md or visual-design.md in list
- Backend-focused description in overview

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Including frontend guides when has_frontend is false
2. ❌ Forgetting to group guides into categories
3. ❌ Missing descriptions for guides
4. ❌ Inconsistent table formatting

6. ❌ Missing navigation tips
7. ❌ Too verbose descriptions (keep to one sentence)
8. ❌ Not linking to related directories
9. ❌ Generic content that doesn't mention project name
10. ❌ Missing "Tip" at the end
