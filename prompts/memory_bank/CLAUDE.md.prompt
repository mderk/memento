# Generation Instructions for CLAUDE.md

## Context

You are generating the root onboarding file (CLAUDE.md) for the project. This file serves as the **first point of contact** for AI assistants (like Claude Code) when they start working on the project.

This file should:
- Introduce the Memory Bank documentation system
- Provide high-level project overview
- List key documents to start with
- Describe available AI agents
- Set expectations for how AI assistants should work with the project

**Audience**: AI assistants (primary), human developers (secondary)
**Tone**: Professional, welcoming, instructive
**Length**: 50-100 lines

## Input Data

You have access to the following project data:

```json
{
  "project_name": "string",
  "project_type": "web_app|api|mobile_app|cli|library|other",
  "project_description": "string",

  "backend_framework": "string|null",
  "frontend_framework": "string|null",
  "database": "string|null",

  "is_monorepo": true|false,
  "backend_dir": "string",
  "frontend_dir": "string|null",

  "has_frontend": true|false,
  "has_backend": true|false,
  "has_database": true|false,

  "primary_language": "string"
}
```

## Output Requirements

### Structure

Generate a markdown file with the following sections:

#### 1. Title
```markdown
# Claude Assistant Onboarding Guide
```
- Simple, clear title
- No project name in title (keep it clean)

#### 2. Start Here: The Memory Bank
- **Lead paragraph**: Welcome message + explanation of Memory Bank as single source of truth
- **Call to action**: Emphasize that AI must prime context by consulting Memory Bank
- **Key documents list**: Numbered list of 3 essential starting documents:
  1. `.memory_bank/README.md` - Project hub/navigation
  2. `.memory_bank/product_brief.md` - Product vision
  3. `.memory_bank/tech_stack.md` - Technical stack

**Use emoji**: 🚀 for section header (ONLY one emoji in entire document)

#### 3. Project Overview
- **Brief description**: 2-3 sentences using `project_description`
- **Project type**: Clearly state what kind of project this is
- **Optional**: Key features if they can be inferred from description

#### 4. Technology Stack (as bulleted sub-section under Project Overview)

**Always include:**
- **Backend**: {backend_framework} (if exists)
- **Frontend**: {frontend_framework} (if exists)
- **Database**: {database} (if exists)
- **Structure**: "Monorepo" or "Single-project application"

**If monorepo:**
Add directory structure:
```markdown
- **Structure**: Monorepo (Backend: `{backend_dir}/`, Frontend: `{frontend_dir}/`)
```

**If not monorepo:**
```markdown
- **Structure**: Single-project application
```

#### 5. Specialized AI Agents

Explain that project uses specialized agents.

**Subsection: Quality Assurance Agents**
- Always include: @code-reviewer, @test-runner
- **Conditionally include @design-reviewer**: ONLY if `has_frontend == true`

Format:
```markdown
-   **@agent-name** (Color) - Brief description
```

**Subsection: Research & Exploration Agents**
- Always include these (universal across all projects):
  - @research-analyst
  - @Explore
  - @general-purpose

#### 6. When They Run
- **Automatically**: Which agents run automatically
- **On Request**: When to invoke manually
- **Learn More**: Links to:
  - `./.memory_bank/guides/ai-agent-handbook.md`
  - `./.memory_bank/workflows/agent-orchestration.md`

#### 7. Footer
Standard closing:
```markdown
---

For any and all other details, **refer to the Memory Bank.** The guides, workflows, and patterns within it are always more up-to-date than this file.

IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context unless it is highly relevant to your task.
```

### Conditional Logic

**If `has_frontend == true`:**
Include @design-reviewer in QA agents:
```markdown
### Quality Assurance Agents

-   **@code-reviewer** (Yellow) - Automated code quality checks and architectural validation
-   **@test-runner** (Orange) - Test execution and comprehensive reporting
-   **@design-reviewer** (Green) - UI/UX design system compliance and accessibility validation
```

**If `has_frontend == false`:**
Exclude @design-reviewer:
```markdown
### Quality Assurance Agents

-   **@code-reviewer** (Yellow) - Automated code quality checks and architectural validation
-   **@test-runner** (Orange) - Test execution and comprehensive reporting
```

**If `is_monorepo == true`:**
```markdown
- **Structure**: Monorepo (Backend: `{backend_dir}/`, Frontend: `{frontend_dir}/`)
```

**If `is_monorepo == false`:**
```markdown
- **Structure**: Single-project application
```

**If `has_backend == false`:**
Omit backend bullet point entirely

**If `has_frontend == false`:**
Omit frontend bullet point entirely

**If `has_database == false`:**
Omit database bullet point entirely

### Style Guidelines

1. **Professional yet welcoming tone**
2. **Use proper markdown hierarchy**: # for title, ## for main sections, ### for subsections
3. **Use relative links**: All links should start with `./` or `.memory_bank/`
4. **Inline code for paths**: Use backticks for directory names like `server/`
5. **Bold for emphasis**: Use **bold** for important concepts like "Memory Bank"
6. **Minimal emoji**: Use exactly 1 emoji (🚀 in section header), no more
7. **No placeholder text**: Everything must be actual content, not "TODO" or "[Add description]"
8. **Consistent formatting**: Ensure lists, code blocks, and sections are consistently formatted

### Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] Project name appears naturally in content (not in title)
- [ ] All technology bullets reflect actual detected stack
- [ ] Monorepo structure matches project data
- [ ] @design-reviewer included ONLY if has_frontend
- [ ] All links use relative paths (`.memory_bank/...`)
- [ ] Exactly 3 starting documents listed
- [ ] Section "When They Run" explains automatic vs manual
- [ ] Footer includes Memory Bank reference and relevance note
- [ ] No {{PLACEHOLDERS}} remain
- [ ] Grammar and spelling perfect
- [ ] Markdown formatting valid

## 🤖 Specialized AI Agents

This project uses specialized AI agents for quality assurance, research, and exploration. The main AI assistant delegates specific tasks to these agents at appropriate stages of development.

### Quality Assurance Agents

-   **@code-reviewer** (Yellow) - Automated code quality checks and architectural validation
-   **@test-runner** (Orange) - Test execution and comprehensive reporting
-   **@design-reviewer** (Green) - UI/UX design system compliance and accessibility validation

### Research & Exploration Agents

-   **@research-analyst** - Research documentation, web pages, and external APIs for implementation context
-   **@Explore** - Fast codebase exploration to find files, search code, and understand implementations
-   **@general-purpose** - Complex multi-step tasks combining research and code exploration

### When They Run

-   **Automatically**: @code-reviewer and @design-reviewer run after completing implementation
-   **On Request**: @test-runner after features are reviewed and ready for testing
-   **Manually**: All agents can be invoked when you need targeted help with specific tasks

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Including {{PLACEHOLDERS}} in final output
2. ❌ Using project name in main title (keep title clean: "Claude Assistant Onboarding Guide")
3. ❌ Including @design-reviewer when has_frontend is false
4. ❌ Wrong directory names (must match backend_dir/frontend_dir from project data)
5. ❌ Absolute paths for links (must use relative: `.memory_bank/...`)
6. ❌ Too many emojis (only 1 allowed: 🚀)
7. ❌ Generic descriptions like "A great project" (use actual project_description)
8. ❌ Missing footer with Memory Bank reference
9. ❌ Incorrect structure type (monorepo vs single-project)
10. ❌ Listing all 3 agent types when only 2 should be listed (no @design-reviewer for API-only)

## Validation

Final checks before returning output:

- [ ] Title is exactly: "# Claude Assistant Onboarding Guide"
- [ ] Exactly 1 emoji (🚀) in document
- [ ] 3 starting documents listed with correct paths
- [ ] Technology stack bullets match project data
- [ ] Monorepo structure shown correctly if is_monorepo
- [ ] @design-reviewer included if and only if has_frontend
- [ ] All links are relative (.memory_bank/...)
- [ ] "When They Run" section explains automatic vs manual
- [ ] Footer includes Memory Bank reference and relevance note
- [ ] No placeholder text or TODOs
- [ ] Grammar and spelling perfect
