# Product Brief Generation Prompt

## Context

You are generating `product_brief.md` - a **factual-only technical overview** of the project.

**CRITICAL RULE: Context-Only Generation**

This file must contain **ONLY** information available in project context:
- ✅ Project description from project-analysis.json
- ✅ Detected technology stack from project-analysis.json
- ✅ Detected architecture from project structure
- ✅ Links to existing Memory Bank guides

**FORBIDDEN sources:**
- ❌ Training data knowledge (market sizes, typical architectures)
- ❌ General assumptions (user needs, success metrics)
- ❌ Invented data (dates, numbers, references, competitors)
- ❌ Generic principles ("Simplicity", "Performance") not from project docs

**Rule:** If information is not in project context → do not include that section.

## Input Data

From `project-analysis.json`:
- `project_name` - Name of the project
- `project_description` - What the project does (use verbatim)
- `project_type` - Type: web_app, api, cli_tool, library, mobile_app
- `backend_framework` - Detected backend (Django, FastAPI, Express, Flask, etc.)
- `frontend_framework` - Detected frontend (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.)
- `database` - Detected database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)
- `is_monorepo` - Boolean: monorepo structure or not
- `has_frontend` - Boolean: includes frontend
- `has_backend` - Boolean: includes backend
- `backend_dir` - Backend directory path (if applicable)
- `frontend_dir` - Frontend directory path (if applicable)

## Output Requirements

Generate a **40-60 line** technical overview with these sections:

### 1. What This Project Does (MANDATORY)

**Source:** Use `project_description` from project-analysis.json **verbatim**.

**Format:**
```markdown
# Product Brief

## Overview

{project_description}
```

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Rephrase or expand the description
- ❌ Add assumptions about users or use cases
- ❌ Invent features not mentioned

### 2. Technology Stack (MANDATORY)

**Source:** Use detected values from project-analysis.json **only**.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Technology Stack

Based on project analysis:

- **Backend**: {backend_framework} (if has_backend)
- **Frontend**: {frontend_framework} (if has_frontend)
- **Database**: {database} (if detected)
- **Architecture**: {is_monorepo ? "Monorepo" : "Single repository"}
```

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Add libraries not detected in project
- ❌ Mention "typical" tools from training data
- ❌ List future technologies or migrations

### 3. Architecture (MANDATORY)

**Source:** Link to architecture.md guide (will exist from generation plan).

**Format:**
```markdown
## Architecture

{Brief 1-2 sentence description based on project_type and structure}

For detailed architecture documentation, see [Architecture Guide](./.memory_bank/guides/architecture.md).
```

**Example (monorepo):**
```markdown
This is a monorepo with separate backend (`server/`) and frontend (`client/`) directories.
```

**Example (API-only):**
```markdown
This is an API service providing RESTful endpoints.
```

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Describe detailed patterns not in project
- ❌ Invent architectural decisions
- ❌ Link to non-existent files

### 4. Technical Constraints (OPTIONAL)

**Source:** ONLY include if explicitly documented in project README or config files.

**When to include:**
- Project README mentions production requirements
- Config files show specific version constraints
- Documentation lists compatibility requirements

**When to skip:**
- No explicit constraints found → omit this section entirely

**Format (if included):**
```markdown
## Technical Constraints

{List constraints found in project documentation}
```

### 5. Development Resources (MANDATORY)

**Source:** Link to Memory Bank guides (will exist from generation plan).

**Format:**
```markdown
## Development Resources

- [Architecture Guide](./.memory_bank/guides/architecture.md) - System design and patterns
- [Backend Guide](./.memory_bank/guides/backend.md) - Backend development (if has_backend)
- [Frontend Guide](./.memory_bank/guides/frontend.md) - Frontend development (if has_frontend)
- [Testing Guide](./.memory_bank/guides/testing.md) - Testing strategies
- [Deployment Guide](./.memory_bank/guides/deployment.md) - Deployment procedures
```

**Conditional links:**
- Only include Backend Guide if `has_backend == true`
- Only include Frontend Guide if `has_frontend == true`
- All other guides always included

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Link to files not in generation plan
- ❌ Create placeholder links like `[Guide](TBD)`

## Style Guidelines

1. **Factual tone**: State facts, don't sell or promote
2. **Concise**: 40-60 lines total, no verbose explanations
3. **English only**: All content in English
4. **No speculation**: Don't predict future features or goals
5. **Verbatim project_description**: Copy exactly, don't rephrase
6. **Detected values only**: Use project-analysis.json data as-is
7. **No broken links**: Only link to files from generation plan

## Sections to NEVER Include

These sections require data not in project context:

- ❌ **Market Context** (TAM, SAM, market size, growth rates)
- ❌ **Competitive Landscape** (competitor products, pricing, features)
- ❌ **User Personas** (unless from actual research in project docs)
- ❌ **Success Metrics** (KPIs, targets, DAU/MAU goals)
- ❌ **Product Principles** (generic values like "Simplicity", "Performance")
- ❌ **Decision Log** (dates, decisions, rationales not in git history)
- ❌ **References** (research documents, market reports not in project)
- ❌ **Roadmap** (timeline, milestones, future features)
- ❌ **Vision & Goals** (business objectives, user impact claims)

**Why removed:** These sections cause LLM to hallucinate data from training knowledge instead of using project context.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] project_description copied verbatim (not rephrased)
- [ ] Technology stack uses detected values only (no invented libraries)
- [ ] Architecture description is factual (no assumed patterns)
- [ ] Links point to files that will exist (from generation plan)
- [ ] No broken links (validate targets exist)
- [ ] File length is 40-60 lines (not 100+)
- [ ] No hallucinated data (market sizes, competitors, dates, metrics)
- [ ] No generic Product Principles (unless from project docs)
- [ ] No User Personas (unless from actual research)
- [ ] No Success Metrics with invented numbers
- [ ] No Decision Log with fabricated dates
- [ ] No References to non-existent documents
- [ ] No Roadmap with timeline speculation
- [ ] All content is in English
- [ ] Professional, factual tone (not promotional)

## Example Output

**Input data:**
```json
{
  "project_name": "TaskFlow",
  "project_description": "A task management system with Kanban boards and time tracking",
  "project_type": "web_app",
  "backend_framework": "Django",
  "frontend_framework": "React",
  "database": "PostgreSQL",
  "is_monorepo": true,
  "has_frontend": true,
  "has_backend": true
}
```

**Expected output (48 lines):**

```markdown
# Product Brief

## Overview

A task management system with Kanban boards and time tracking.

## Technology Stack

Based on project analysis:

- **Backend**: Django
- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Architecture**: Monorepo

The project uses a modern web stack optimized for rapid development and scalability.

## Architecture

This is a monorepo with separate backend and frontend directories.

For detailed architecture documentation, see [Architecture Guide](./.memory_bank/guides/architecture.md).

## Development Resources

- [Architecture Guide](./.memory_bank/guides/architecture.md) - System design and patterns
- [Backend Guide](./.memory_bank/guides/backend.md) - Backend development
- [Frontend Guide](./.memory_bank/guides/frontend.md) - Frontend development
- [Testing Guide](./.memory_bank/guides/testing.md) - Testing strategies
- [Deployment Guide](./.memory_bank/guides/deployment.md) - Deployment procedures
```

**Note:** This example is 48 lines - concise, factual, zero hallucinations.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rephrasing project_description** → Use verbatim
2. **Adding libraries not detected** → Only use project-analysis.json
3. **Including market data** → No TAM, competitors, pricing
4. **Inventing Product Principles** → Skip unless from project docs
5. **Creating User Personas** → Skip unless from actual research
6. **Adding Success Metrics** → No KPIs, targets, DAU goals
7. **Fabricating Decision Log** → No dates, decisions not in git
8. **Listing References** → No market reports, research docs
9. **Planning Roadmap** → No timeline, milestones, future features
10. **Breaking links** → Only link to generation plan files
11. **Verbose explanations** → Keep to 40-60 lines total
12. **Generic promotional text** → Factual tone only
