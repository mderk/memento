# Generation Instructions for CLAUDE.md

## Context

You are generating the root onboarding file (CLAUDE.md) for the project. This file serves as the **entry point** for AI assistants - it should be minimal and immediately direct them to the Memory Bank.

**Key principle**: CLAUDE.md is a POINTER, not documentation. All content lives in Memory Bank.

**Audience**: AI assistants (primary), human developers (secondary)
**Tone**: Direct, concise
**Length**: 20-35 lines (STRICT - no more)

## Input Data

```json
{
  "project_name": "string"
}
```

## Output Requirements

### Structure

Generate a minimal CLAUDE.md with exactly these sections:

#### 1. Title
```markdown
# Claude Assistant Onboarding Guide
```

#### 2. Start Here (THE CORE SECTION)
```markdown
## Start Here

**Read `.memory_bank/README.md`** - the single source of truth for this project.

It contains:

- Project overview and navigation
- **MANDATORY development workflow** (required before any coding)
- Guides, patterns, and workflows
- AI agent delegation rules

All technical documentation lives in the Memory Bank. This file only points you there.
```

#### 3. Documentation-First Rule
```markdown
## Documentation-First Rule

**Before using Glob, Grep, or exploring code** for any task, follow this order:

1. **Read this file** (CLAUDE.md)
2. **Read `.memory_bank/README.md`** - find the relevant guide in the navigation table
3. **Read the specific guide**
4. **Only then** search or explore code if needed

The README.md contains navigation tables that point directly to documentation.
Do not search before reading the README.md.
```

### What NOT to Include

**DO NOT include any of these** (they belong in README.md):
- ❌ Project description or overview
- ❌ Technology stack listing
- ❌ Agent descriptions or lists
- ❌ "When They Run" sections
- ❌ "Learn More" link sections
- ❌ Footer with relevance disclaimers
- ❌ Emoji (except sparingly)

### Style Guidelines

1. **Ultra-concise**: Every line must earn its place
2. **Directive**: Tell AI what to do, not explain things
3. **Single focus**: Point to README.md, nothing else
4. **No duplication**: Zero overlap with README.md content

### Quality Checklist

- [ ] Total lines: 20-35 (STRICT)
- [ ] Title is exactly: "# Claude Assistant Onboarding Guide"
- [ ] "Start Here" section points to .memory_bank/README.md
- [ ] "Documentation-First Rule" section present
- [ ] NO project description
- [ ] NO tech stack
- [ ] NO agent listings
- [ ] NO "When They Run" section
- [ ] NO "Learn More" links
- [ ] NO footer disclaimers
- [ ] Grammar perfect
- [ ] Markdown valid

## Example Output

```markdown
# Claude Assistant Onboarding Guide

## Start Here

**Read `.memory_bank/README.md`** - the single source of truth for this project.

It contains:

- Project overview and navigation
- **MANDATORY development workflow** (required before any coding)
- Guides, patterns, and workflows
- AI agent delegation rules

All technical documentation lives in the Memory Bank. This file only points you there.

## Documentation-First Rule

**Before using Glob, Grep, or exploring code** for any task, follow this order:

1. **Read this file** (CLAUDE.md)
2. **Read `.memory_bank/README.md`** - find the relevant guide in the navigation table
3. **Read the specific guide**
4. **Only then** search or explore code if needed

The README.md contains navigation tables that point directly to documentation.
Do not search before reading the README.md.
```

This is the COMPLETE output - nothing more should be added.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Adding project overview (belongs in README.md)
2. ❌ Listing technology stack (belongs in tech_stack.md)
3. ❌ Describing AI agents (belongs in README.md and ai-agent-handbook.md)
4. ❌ Adding "When They Run" section (belongs in agent-orchestration.md)
5. ❌ Including footer disclaimers (unnecessary noise)
6. ❌ Exceeding 35 lines (file must stay minimal)
7. ❌ Using multiple emojis (keep it clean)

## Validation

- [ ] Line count: 20-35 lines
- [ ] Points to .memory_bank/README.md prominently
- [ ] Contains Documentation-First Rule
- [ ] Contains NO other content sections
- [ ] No placeholders remain
- [ ] Grammar perfect
