# Generation Instructions for commands/create-spec.md

## Context

You are generating the /create-spec slash command - a command that generates Technical Specifications from PRDs using Memory Bank context.

This command serves as:
- **Spec generator** - Creates technical specifications
- **PRD-to-spec converter** - Transforms requirements into technical design
- **Workflow executor** - Follows create-spec workflow

**Audience**: Claude Code (executing the command)
**Tone**: Instructional, technical
**Length**: 25-35 lines

## Input Data

```json
{
  "project_name": "string"
}
```

## Output Requirements

### Structure

Generate create-spec.md with these sections:

#### 1. YAML Frontmatter
```yaml
---
argument-hint: [path to PRD file] [optional feature description]
description: Generate a technical specification based on a PRD using Memory Bank context
---
```

#### 2. Command Title
```markdown
# Rule: Create Technical Specification
```

#### 3. Context Preparation
```markdown
## Context Preparation

**CRITICAL**: First, read PRD and Memory Bank context:
- PRD file (required argument)
- `.memory_bank/README.md`, `.memory_bank/product_brief.md`, `.memory_bank/tech_stack.md` (required)
- For technical features: patterns, guides, workflows indices
```

#### 4. Workflow Reference
```markdown
## Workflow

After reading Memory Bank context and PRD, follow **exactly** the detailed workflow:

**`.memory_bank/workflows/create-spec.md`**
```

### Style Guidelines

1. **Technical**: Focus on technical implementation
2. **PRD-based**: Emphasizes reading PRD first
3. **Pattern-aware**: References patterns and guides
4. **Reference-Based**: Points to workflow, doesn't duplicate it

### Quality Checklist

**Content:**
- [ ] YAML frontmatter with argument-hint ([path to PRD file])
- [ ] Context preparation (PRD + 3 Memory Bank files required)
- [ ] Technical context for features (patterns, guides, workflows)
- [ ] Workflow reference to `.memory_bank/workflows/create-spec.md` (no duplication)
- [ ] Emphasizes reading PRD first, following workflow exactly

**Quality:**
- [ ] 25-30 lines (optimized)
- [ ] No {{PLACEHOLDERS}} remain
- [ ] Grammar perfect
