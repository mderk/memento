# Changelog

All notable changes to the Memento plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

-   **`get_all_mb_files()` scans all file types**: Previously only scanned `*.md`, causing non-markdown files (`defer.py`, `load-context.py`) to be falsely reported as "missing" by `detect`

### Changed

-   **`update-plan` auto-add and `--remove`**: New files are auto-inserted into the correct plan section (Guides, Workflows, etc.); `--remove` flag deletes obsolete rows
-   **Defer skill**: Added `area`/`effort` fields, list filters (`--type`, `--area`, `--priority`, `--effort`), `view` command for grouped dashboards, inline-comment stripping in frontmatter parsing

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

-   **`/doc-gardening`** (command + workflow): Memory Bank maintenance entrypoint — link integrity, redundancy, freshness, knowledge promotion
-   **`/update-memory-bank-protocol`** (command): Post-protocol Memory Bank update from Findings (promoted from skill to command)
-   **`AGENTS.md`** wrapper: Thin redirect to `CLAUDE.md` so all agents load the same rules
-   **Harness tests**: `test_readme_prompt_is_a_map_not_a_manual`, `test_agents_wrappers_point_to_claude_md`, `test_shipped_templates_use_namespaced_gardening_commands`

### Changed

-   **Namespaced gardening commands**: shipped docs reference `/memento:fix-broken-links` and `/memento:optimize-memory-bank` instead of thin local wrappers
-   **README.md.prompt**: Slimmed from 200-400 → 120-220 line target ("map, not manual"); removed verbose examples, simplified directory tree
-   **CLAUDE.md**: Added "What matters", "Golden commands", "Mechanical invariants" sections; removed `scripts/` from directory tree
-   **Skill script paths**: All four skills (`analyze-local-changes`, `check-redundancy`, `detect-tech-stack`, `fix-broken-links`) now use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/…/scripts/` absolute paths instead of broken relative `./scripts/` references
-   **Post-generation validation**: `create-environment` Phase 3 and `update-environment` Step 5 now run `/memento:fix-broken-links` (mandatory) and verify merge stats inline
-   **Dev command rename**: `/import-knowledge` → `/import-knowledge-into-plugin` to avoid confusion with `/memento:import-knowledge`

### Removed

-   **`commands/fix-broken-links.md`**: Thin wrapper deleted — `/memento:fix-broken-links` is the only entry point
-   **`static/skills/update-memory-bank-protocol/`**: Promoted to `static/commands/update-memory-bank-protocol.md`
-   **`scripts/`** directory: Deleted `validate-links.py` (superseded by skill), `check-redundancy.py` (identical dead copy), and `README.md`

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

-   **3-way merge system** in `analyze-local-changes`:
    -   Section-level 3-way merge (`merge` command) using Generation Base as common ancestor
    -   Two-commit system (`commit-generation` command): Generation Base (clean plugin output) + Generation Commit (after merge)
    -   Preserves user-added sections and local modifications across repeated `/update-environment` runs
    -   Conflict detection: `both_modified`, `plugin_removed_user_modified`, `both_added`, `user_deleted`
    -   Anchor-based positioning for user-added sections in merged output
-   **Protocol completeness review competency** (`review/protocol-completeness.md`): Document-specific review for protocols and specs
    -   Implementability, cross-step consistency, edge case coverage, missing pieces checklist

### Changed

-   **Prompt→static conversion**: Converted 15 prompt-based files (agents, commands, workflows) to static files for direct deployment without LLM generation
    -   Agents: `design-reviewer`, `developer`, `research-analyst`
    -   Commands: `create-prd`, `create-spec`, `create-protocol`, `process-protocol`, `prime`, `run-tests`, `develop`
    -   Workflows: `index`, `bug-fixing`, `agent-orchestration`, `create-prd`, `create-spec`
    -   Skill: `commit/SKILL.md`
-   **`README.md`**: Condensed to focused quick-reference
-   **`CLAUDE.md`**: Rewritten as concise developer guide
-   **`SPECIFICATION.md`**: Updated to reflect current architecture (prompt counts, static counts, merge system)
-   **`GETTING_STARTED.md`**: Fixed progress counters (18 prompt files, not 33) and static file counts
-   **`CUSTOMIZATION.md`**: Removed nonexistent `plugin-config.json` section and `/sync-docs` reference, fixed GitHub URLs, updated regeneration docs to describe Phase 0 options
-   **`manifest.yaml`**: Added `review/protocol-completeness.md`, new static agents/commands/workflows/skills

### Removed

-   **15 prompt templates**: Replaced by static files (see Changed above)
-   **`agents/developer.md`**, **`commands/develop.md`**, **`skills/commit/SKILL.md`**: Moved to `static/`
-   **`docs/archive/`**: Removed archived planning documents (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, PRD, RESEARCH_REPORT)

-   **`environment-generator.md`**: Added rules for pattern-based code examples and command variables
-   **`anti-patterns.md`**: Added Anti-Pattern #26 with detection rules and examples
-   **Testing prompts**: All testing prompts now use `{commands.*}` variables instead of hardcoded commands, and show framework patterns with generic entity names (Item, Button) instead of project-specific hallucinated names
-   **`code-review-workflow.md`** (static): Restructured competency tables
    -   Testing competency moved from project-specific to universal
